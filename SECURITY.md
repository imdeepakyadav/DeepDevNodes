- **📋 Audit Logs**: Comprehensive audit trails

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting Bypass

- **Risk**: Potential bypass of rate limiting mechanisms
- **Mitigation**: Multiple layers of rate limiting and monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of request patterns

### API Key Exposure

- **Risk**: Accidental exposure of API keys in logs or code
- **Mitigation**: Environment variables, key rotation, monitoring
- **Response**: Immediate key invalidation and user notification

### Data Leakage

- **Risk**: Sensitive data exposure through API responses
- **Mitigation**: Response sanitization and data classification
- **Monitoring**: Automated scanning for sensitive data patterns

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Security Settings
NODE_ENV=production
